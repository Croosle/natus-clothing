              SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY

              In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

              SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT

              The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

          <p class="about-window-text">Destiny. A powerful force that pre-determines the course of events. Destiny. The force that pre-determined the creation of NATUS.

      Around the end of 2017, the aftermath of a business failure triggered a desire to create a new clothing label. A clothing label that would balance both the respect for a clean aesthetic and the drive to design couture-esque, experimental garments.

      Our first collection, FALLEN LEGENDS//01, was the result of a perfect equilibrium we found. Inspired by streetwear design, and executed with high fashion precision, the combination produced t-shirts worthy of haute-couture status.

      Made locally in Scotland, every piece is made to order, using only the finest materials and most, meticulous processes.

      On reflection, if it wasn’t for failure, there would have been no reason to establish NATUS. The previous company was ultimately destined to fail. Destined to fail so that NATUS could be born out of it.

      If you’re wondering what NATUS means, it’s Latin for ‘destined by nature’. If you’re wondering how to pronounce it, there is no right or wrong way as long as you remember who we are.

      <strong class="about-window_strong">1 /HUNDRED POLICY</strong>

      To ensure every piece we make to order is a truly one off, each garment is numbered. and we've capped the max. quantity we sell to just 100 pcs, per design.

      Orders are produced in limited batches each week. Every new batch is assigned its own drop / release date. When a batch sells out, a new drop is released, due for a later dispatch date. Orders are available on a first come, first served basis. The sooner you buy, the sooner you receive.</p>

                <p class="shirt_desc-text">Dear Diary,

      It was a morning in October. The early dawn light shone through the curtain and encouraged me to get up. I felt a desire to create, to build something.

      I looked for fabrics to work with and in a pile of scraps, two stood out. One was a soft, sandy brown cotton jersey. The other was polar opposite. It was a digital desert camouflage print. Both fabrics were light, and despite their contrast, I wanted them to become as one.

      Halfway through my morning coffee, I pictured a layered outfit, and its appeal. Two different tops, one on top of the other, working in tandem. What if I could recreate that? Without the need for two separate pieces…I didn’t have a lot of the print fabric so I thought, that could be the base, and the sand fabric could be the t-shirt on top. So if you looked at it from the front or back you’d see, a standard t-shirt on top, and part of a patterned t-shirt underneath. It’d even work similarly for the sleeves, if you rolled them up.

      First, I had to map out the shape of the top. I looked around for inspiration, and found nothing. I realised what I was missing, a cosy t-shirt to feel wrapped up in. So I decided, it’d have to be oversized. Not so much, long, because I’m not into those dress length t-shirts. But wide, like one of those stretched out jumpers everyone has at the bottom of their wardrobe.

      As I finished sewing the two fabrics together, I realised it was getting dark and I hadn’t taken a break since I woke up. Problem was, I couldn’t stop thinking about what would complete the piece. I had this crazy idea of making embroidery, but had no design or idea in mind.

      I was about to go to bed when I saw it, staring at me. The poster above my desk of the iconic Che Guevara silhouette. I couldn’t sleep after that, so I stayed up all night, creating a pixelated version of the famous portrait. It was embroidery, literally made from individual squares that looked like pixels, on a piece of white denim that I sewed on to the left breast pocket area of the top t-shirt. I thought it looked like a playing card, because I sewed on the letter ‘G’ and a mini version of the main shape in each corner, like the ace of spades.

      The whole top took me a full 24 hours to make, but it was worth it.

      P.S If, somehow, you've came across my diary and you’re reading this entry, it may be hard to imagine what I’m describing. Which is why, I’ve included a photo to your right, enjoy. :)</p>

              <div class="shirt_desc">
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">It’s Isabella Blow speaking from London on behalf of McQueen for NATUS. Isabella Blow. B.L.O.W.</p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">When I first saw McQueen, it was the colours and silhouette which initially drew me to it. It was something very special. Maybe it’s because, I’ve always had blue wherever I go. My apartment in New York was light blue. This particular blue reminds me of skies in winter - that cold pastel blue. And that hint of yellow in the print, is like the faint glow of the sun, dipping below the tree-line. It was vivid, extreme.</p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">And the way it moved, it moved in a way I’ve never seen for a t-shirt. It wasn’t overly long, but it was wide. Like a monolith. As were the sleeves - they had this very oversized silhouette, very chic. </p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">People think I like really funky stuff. I like classic with a twist. I like things that are cut beautifully. I’m obsessed with the idea of two layers in one piece. There’s this mixture of smooth, from the soft cotton jersey on top, and texture, from the light crepe fabric below. It’s erotic. The combination of contrasting materials works, you know….there is something very kind of naughty about it. </p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">Can you feel the emotion in the print? It’s about love. Love for colour, love for adventure. An artist, using his watercolours, to splash, smear, streak, give life to his canvas. Blending blues, yellows, greys, to create this incredible beauty. It's elegant, yet thrilling. Yeah it’s just pure luxury, very sexy. And if you like that burst of colour on your sleeves, roll them up - show some of that wonderful print underneath.</p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">Oh darling, I haven’t even told you about the embroidery. It's complex and modern, yet classical. I sense the skull has a deeper meaning, not representative of death but of foundation. It's the essential structure that holds our most intricate organ, the brain. Each block of embroidered thread is singular and links with one another to create a whole shape, much like the way pixels on an old computer display would make up an image. The variation in every pixel’s colour gives it such an individual feel. Its effect is very severe. Your own mega-sized ace of skulls.</p>
                <p class="shirt_desc-text">I hate crap, I like craftsmanship, and this is skill in its purest form. Once your head goes over that t-shirt, it’s the most comfortable thing in the world. It’s no longer a t-shirt, it’s like wearing a piece of couture.</p>

            If, for any reason, you're unhappy with the order you've received, you can return the goods within 30 days of receipt. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can't offer you a refund or exchange.

            To return or exchange your order please email hello@natusclothing.com with the subject ‘Return’. You will need to state your order number, name, contact details, item you are returning, whether it’s a request for an exchange or refund, and your reason for the return.

            Please note that return shipments are at the customer’s own expense. Unfortunately, taxes, duties and original shipping fees are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from it. Authorised returns must be shipped using the carrier suggested by NATUS in the email providing the return instructions. We prefer that items are returned to us via our own service so that they are protected, tracked and insured. We do reserve the right not to accept returns if the customer uses a different carrier.

            To be eligible for a return or exchange, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. We are not able to refund or exchange items that appear to have been worn, washed, or are not in original condition.

            Purchased items are only exchangeable for a different size. Due to our sales policy, we are unable to exchange the returned item for another style. All exchanges are based on stock availability and are shipped to you free of charge.

            We cannot take responsibility for items damaged or lost in the return transit.
            If you’re returning an item from outside the EU, please clearly mark the package 'RETURNED GOODS', to avoid any customs charges. NATUS is not responsible for any return custom charges made.

            Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.

            If you receive an item in a flawed or damaged condition, please contact hello@natusclothing.com as soon as possible. Where possible, we will arrange for a new replacement to be sent to you. Please note that items which are damaged or as a result of normal wear and tear; by accident; or through misuse will not be considered faulty.

            We have made every effort to display the colours of our products as accurately as possible. However, as computer monitors, tablets and mobile devices vary, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of a colour will be completely accurate.
            If, for any reason, you wish to cancel your order before your items have been dispatched, please email your cancellation marked ‘URGENT CANCELLATION’ to hello@natusclothing.com and list your name, address, product ordered and order code on the email.

            Returns that do not meet our policy will not be accepted and sent back to the customer.


            REFUNDS

            Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will then notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
            If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment.
            Refunds will also be set at the price you paid, not the price in the currency concerned at the date of refund.

            LATE OR MISSING REFUNDS

            If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
            Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
            Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
            If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at hello@natusclothing.com

            GIFTS

            If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return.
            If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver.

            All orders are shipped worldwide with DHL Express.

            Orders are produced in limited batches each week. Every new batch is assigned its own drop / release date. When a batch sells out, a new drop is released, due for a later dispatch date. Orders are available on a first come, first served basis.

            Due to the bespoke nature of how pieces are produced and sold, dispatch times may vary from 2-6 weeks. At checkout, next to your chosen drop, you'll be shown an estimated dispatch date. We will also include your dispatch date in the order confirmation, aswell as providing email updates as your piece goes through production.

            If you prefer not to wait, and instead, cancel your order, you will be entitled to a full and immediate refund. Please contact us at hello@natusclothing.com
            If 24 hours have gone by since your order confirmation and we’ve not received a cancellation email, unfortunately we can't offer you a refund.

            A signature is required upon delivery and if you are absent at the first delivery attempt, the driver will make a second delivery attempt on the next working day. You can change the delivery date by 10:30 pm (UK) that day.

            Please keep in mind that our shipping times should be used as a guide only and are based on time from dispatch. NATUS will not be held responsible for a delay in shipment caused by weather conditions, international customs issues or any other circumstances beyond our control.

            Orders cannot be shipped to P.O boxes and all expedited orders require a street address.

            The rate charged for the shipping of your order is based on your location. Before the final checkout page you will be shown what the cost of shipping will be, and you will have a chance to not place your order if you decide not to.

            Please note, due to the design of our packaging, we are unable to place more than 1 item in the same box. If more than a single item is ordered, we will process them separately and have to charge the same rate for posting the second, additional item.

            TRACKING

            Customers will receive an email with tracking information when the order is ready to be shipped. If you don’t receive an email, please check your spam folder and see if you can locate it. If it still can’t be found after 48 hours, contact our customer care team at hello@natusclothing.com for support.

            To monitor the status of your order, customers may visit http://www.dhl.co.uk/en/express/tracking.html and insert their given tracking number.

            Our shipping partner, DHL, also offers you the flexibility to make changes to your delivery while your purchase is on its way to you. Enter your mobile number at checkout to receive an SMS notification after your order has been dispatched, follow the link provided and choose from a range of options including:
            Rescheduling your delivery for a nominated day
            Placing your shipment on hold if you are away from home
            Arranging to collect your order from a DHL service point

            INSURANCE

            From the moment of dispatch the package is fully insured with DHL against damage, theft and loss. Once the package has been signed for by the customer the responsibility shifts to the customer and the insurance is void. We urge customers to not accept packages that are damaged, broken or seem to have been tampered with. In such cases contact our customer care team at hello@natusclothing.com for support.

            TAXES & DUTIES

            Unfortunately, we are unable to cover the cost of customs, duties and taxes, for international shipments outside the EU. When an international destination is selected, the price you pay to NATUS will exclude all relevant import duties and sales taxes. As the recipient of the order, you must instead pay these duties and taxes directly to our carrier to release your order from customs. These are the sole responsibility of the customer and will not be reimbursed by NATUS. As we are unable to advise the exact amount, we recommend contacting your local customs office or tax authority before placing a DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid) order. We will always seek your confirmation by email prior to dispatching a DDU order, so please look out for this email to ensure timely dispatch of your order.
            The customer must take full liability for any parcels returned to us due to unpaid customs charges. Postal charges, return shipment costs, customs charges and handling fees will all be deductible from any refund due.

            SHIPPING TO USA

            For international orders shipped to customers in the US, please be aware that US Customs may ask for your IRS, EIN or SSN number before enabling delivery to your address. You will normally have one week to provide this information before your order is returned to NATUS for a refund.
